 `logic.py` module defines classes for symbolic logic constructs (like symbols, connectives, and functions for evaluating logical expressions) and provides tools for performing model checking. This module enables you to create logical expressions, evaluate their truth values based on provided models, and determine if one logical expression follows from another within a given knowledge base.
 ***
 ## Importing required libraries
 The line `import itertools` at the beginning of the code imports the `itertools` module, which is a built-in Python module that provides various functions and iterators for working with iterators and combinatorial operations. `itertools` is part of the Python standard library and comes with Python by default, so you don't need to install anything to use it.

## Defining a class for representing symbols

```python
# Define a class for representing symbols
class Symbol():
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name  # Initialize the symbol with a given name

    def __repr__(self):
        return self.name  # Return the name of the symbol when it's converted to a string representation

    def evaluate(self, model):
        try:
            return model[self.name]  # Try to retrieve the value from the model dictionary
        except KeyError:
            raise Exception(f"variable {self.name} not in model")  # Raise an exception if the symbol's value is not found in the model

    def formula(self):
        return self.name  # Return the name of the symbol as its formula representation

    def symbols(self):
        return {self.name}  # Return a set containing the name of this symbol
```

Now, let's break down each method and its purpose:

1. `__init__(self, name)`: This is the constructor method for the `Symbol` class. It takes one argument, `name`, which is a string representing the name of the symbol. When you create an instance of the `Symbol` class, you provide a name for that symbol, and it gets stored as an attribute (`self.name`) of the object.

2. `__repr__(self)`: This is a special method in Python that defines the string representation of an object when using the `repr()` function or when the object is displayed in an interactive environment (e.g., in a REPL or Jupyter Notebook). In this case, it simply returns the `name` attribute as a string, so when you print a `Symbol` object, it will display its name.

3. `evaluate(self, model)`: This method is used to evaluate the truth value of the symbol within a given model. It takes a `model` as an argument, which is expected to be a dictionary where keys are symbol names and values are Boolean truth values. It tries to look up the symbol's name in the `model` dictionary and return its corresponding truth value. If the symbol is not found in the `model`, it raises an exception indicating that the variable is not in the model.

4. `formula(self)`: This method returns the formula representation of the symbol, which is simply its name as a string. For example, if the symbol has a name "A," calling `formula()` on it would return "A."

5. `symbols(self)`: This method returns a set containing the name of the symbol. It's used to collect all symbols present in an expression. In this case, it returns a set with a single element, which is the name of the symbol itself. This is helpful for collecting symbols from more complex logical expressions.

In summary, the `Symbol` class is designed to represent and work with individual symbols in a logical system. It can store the symbol's name, evaluate its truth value within a given model, and provide its string representation and the ability to collect symbols.
***
## Defining a class for Negation

```python
# Define a class for negation
class Not():
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name  # Initialize the negation with an expression (symbol or another logical expression)

    def __repr__(self):
        return f"Not({self.name})"  # Return a string representation of the negation expression

    def evaluate(self, model):
        return not self.name.evaluate(model)  # Evaluate the negation: negate the evaluation result of the expression

    def formula(self):
        return "¬" + self.name.formula()  # Return the formula representation of the negation expression

    def symbols(self):
        return self.name.symbols()  # Gather symbols used in the negation expression
```

Let's go through each method and its purpose:

1. `__init__(self, name)`: This is the constructor method that initializes a `Not` object with an expression (logical symbol or another logical expression) that needs to be negated.

2. `__repr__(self)`: This special method is called when the object needs to be represented as a string, such as when using the `print()` function or during string formatting. In this case, it returns a string representation of the negation operation that includes the expression being negated.

3. `evaluate(self, model)`: This method takes a `model` dictionary as an argument and evaluates the negation operation. It negates the evaluation result of the expression passed as the argument to the constructor.

4. `formula(self)`: This method returns the formula representation of the negation operation, which is the negation symbol "¬" followed by the formula representation of the expression being negated.

5. `symbols(self)`: This method gathers the set of symbols used in the negation expression. It simply delegates this task to the expression being negated.

Overall, the `Not` class encapsulates the behavior of the logical negation operation. It allows you to create negations of logical expressions, evaluate their truth values, retrieve their formula representations, and gather symbols used within the negation. This is an essential component for constructing more complex logical expressions and evaluating their truth values.
***
## Defining a class for conjunction

```python
# Define a class for conjunction (AND)
class And():
    def __init__(self, *conjuncts):
        self.conjuncts = list(conjuncts)  # Initialize with a list of conjunct expressions

    def __repr__(self):
        conjunctions = ", ".join([str(conjunct) for conjunct in self.conjuncts])
        return f"And({conjunctions})"  # Return a string representation of the conjunction expression

    def add(self, conjunct):
        self.conjuncts.append(conjunct)  # Add a new conjunct expression

    def evaluate(self, model):
        return all(conjunct.evaluate(model) for conjunct in self.conjuncts)  # Evaluate all conjuncts and return True if all are True

    def formula(self):
        if len(self.conjuncts) == 1:
            return self.conjuncts[0].formula()
        return " ∧ ".join([conjunct.formula() for conjunct in self.conjuncts])  # Return the formula representation of the conjunction expression

    def symbols(self):
        return set.union(*[conjunct.symbols() for conjunct in self.conjuncts])  # Gather symbols used in the conjunction expression
```

Let's go through each method and its purpose:

1. `__init__(self, *conjuncts)`: This is the constructor method that initializes an `And` object with a variable number of conjunct expressions (logical symbols or other logical expressions).

2. `__repr__(self)`: This special method is called when the object needs to be represented as a string, such as when using the `print()` function or during string formatting. In this case, it returns a string representation of the conjunction expression that includes all the conjuncts.

3. `add(self, conjunct)`: This method allows adding a new conjunct expression to the existing conjunction. It's a way to build more complex conjunctions.

4. `evaluate(self, model)`: This method takes a `model` dictionary as an argument and evaluates the conjunction operation. It evaluates all the conjunct expressions and returns `True` if all of them are `True`.

5. `formula(self)`: This method returns the formula representation of the conjunction expression. If there's only one conjunct, it returns the formula of that conjunct. Otherwise, it returns a string that joins the formula representations of all conjuncts using the logical AND symbol "∧".

6. `symbols(self)`: This method gathers the set of symbols used in the conjunction expression. It delegates this task to the symbols used in all the conjunct expressions and then combines them into a single set.

Overall, the `And` class encapsulates the behavior of the logical conjunction operation. It allows you to create conjunctions of logical expressions, evaluate their truth values, retrieve their formula representations, and gather symbols used within the conjunction. This is essential for building complex logical expressions and performing various logical operations.
***
## Defining a class for disjunction

```python
# Define a class for disjunction (OR)
class Or():
    def __init__(self, *disjuncts):
        self.disjuncts = list(disjuncts)  # Initialize with a list of disjunct expressions

    def __repr__(self):
        disjuncts = ", ".join([str(disjunct) for disjunct in self.disjuncts])
        return f"Or({disjuncts})"  # Return a string representation of the disjunction expression

    def evaluate(self, model):
        return any(disjunct.evaluate(model) for disjunct in self.disjuncts)  # Evaluate all disjuncts and return True if any is True

    def formula(self):
        if len(self.disjuncts) == 1:
            return self.disjuncts[0].formula()
        return " ∨ ".join([disjunct.formula() for disjunct in self.disjuncts])  # Return the formula representation of the disjunction expression

    def symbols(self):
        return set.union(*[disjunct.symbols() for disjunct in self.disjuncts])  # Gather symbols used in the disjunction expression
```

Let's go through each method and its purpose:

1. `__init__(self, *disjuncts)`: This is the constructor method that initializes an `Or` object with a variable number of disjunct expressions (logical symbols or other logical expressions).

2. `__repr__(self)`: This special method is called when the object needs to be represented as a string, such as when using the `print()` function or during string formatting. In this case, it returns a string representation of the disjunction expression that includes all the disjuncts.

3. `evaluate(self, model)`: This method takes a `model` dictionary as an argument and evaluates the disjunction operation. It evaluates all the disjunct expressions and returns `True` if at least one of them is `True`.

4. `formula(self)`: This method returns the formula representation of the disjunction expression. If there's only one disjunct, it returns the formula of that disjunct. Otherwise, it returns a string that joins the formula representations of all disjuncts using the logical OR symbol "∨".

5. `symbols(self)`: This method gathers the set of symbols used in the disjunction expression. It delegates this task to the symbols used in all the disjunct expressions and then combines them into a single set.

Overall, the `Or` class encapsulates the behavior of the logical disjunction operation. It allows you to create disjunctions of logical expressions, evaluate their truth values, retrieve their formula representations, and gather symbols used within the disjunction. This is crucial for constructing complex logical expressions and performing various logical operations.
***
## Defining a class for implication

```python
# Define a class for implication
class Implication():
    def __init__(self, left, right):
        self.left = left  # Initialize with the left-hand side expression
        self.right = right  # Initialize with the right-hand side expression

    def __repr__(self):
        return f"Implication({self.left}, {self.right})"  # Return a string representation of the implication expression

    def evaluate(self, model):
        return (not self.left.evaluate(model)) or self.right.evaluate(model)  # Evaluate the implication expression

    def formula(self):
        left = self.left.formula()
        right = self.right.formula()
        return f"{left} => {right}"  # Return the formula representation of the implication expression

    def symbols(self):
        return set.union(self.left.symbols(), self.right.symbols())  # Gather symbols used in the implication expression
```

Let's go through each method and its purpose:

1. `__init__(self, left, right)`: This is the constructor method that initializes an `Implication` object with left and right expressions (logical symbols or other logical expressions) representing the left and right sides of the implication.

2. `__repr__(self)`: This special method is called when the object needs to be represented as a string, such as when using the `print()` function or during string formatting. In this case, it returns a string representation of the implication expression that includes both the left and right sides.

3. `evaluate(self, model)`: This method takes a `model` dictionary as an argument and evaluates the implication operation. The implication is `True` unless the left-hand side is `True` and the right-hand side is `False`.

4. `formula(self)`: This method returns the formula representation of the implication expression. It combines the formula representations of the left and right sides using the logical implication symbol "=>" to indicate that the left side implies the right side.

5. `symbols(self)`: This method gathers the set of symbols used in the implication expression. It delegates this task to the symbols used in both the left and right sides of the implication and then combines them into a single set.

Overall, the `Implication` class encapsulates the behavior of the logical implication operation. It allows you to create implications of logical expressions, evaluate their truth values, retrieve their formula representations, and gather symbols used within the implication. This is crucial for constructing complex logical expressions and performing various logical operations, such as modeling causal relationships.
***
## Defining a class for biconditional
```python
# Define a class for biconditional
class Biconditional():
    def __init__(self, left, right):
        self.left = left  # Initialize with the left-hand side expression
        self.right = right  # Initialize with the right-hand side expression

    def __repr__(self):
        return f"Biconditional({self.left}, {self.right})"  # Return a string representation of the biconditional expression

    def evaluate(self, model):
        return ((self.left.evaluate(model) and self.right.evaluate(model))
                or (not self.left.evaluate(model) and not self.right.evaluate(model)))  # Evaluate the biconditional expression

    def formula(self):
        left = str(self.left)
        right = str(self.right)
        return f"{left} <=> {right}"  # Return the formula representation of the biconditional expression

    def symbols(self):
        return set.union(self.left.symbols(), self.right.symbols())  # Gather symbols used in the biconditional expression
```

Let's go through each method and its purpose:

1. `__init__(self, left, right)`: This is the constructor method that initializes a `Biconditional` object with left and right expressions (logical symbols or other logical expressions) representing the left and right sides of the biconditional.

2. `__repr__(self)`: This special method is called when the object needs to be represented as a string, such as when using the `print()` function or during string formatting. In this case, it returns a string representation of the biconditional expression that includes both the left and right sides.

3. `evaluate(self, model)`: This method takes a `model` dictionary as an argument and evaluates the biconditional operation. The biconditional is `True` if both sides have the same truth value.

4. `formula(self)`: This method returns the formula representation of the biconditional expression. It combines the string representations of the left and right sides using the logical biconditional symbol "<=>" to indicate that the left side is equivalent to the right side.

5. `symbols(self)`: This method gathers the set of symbols used in the biconditional expression. It delegates this task to the symbols used in both the left and right sides of the biconditional and then combines them into a single set.

Overall, the `Biconditional` class encapsulates the behavior of the logical biconditional operation. It allows you to create biconditionals of logical expressions, evaluate their truth values, retrieve their formula representations, and gather symbols used within the biconditional. This is useful for expressing equivalence between two logical statements.
***
## Truth Table

```python
# Function to create truth table for a set of symbols
def create_table(symbols):
    values = [True, False]  # Possible truth values for each symbol
    num_columns = len(symbols)  # Number of symbols in the set
    all_combinations = list(itertools.product(values, repeat=num_columns))  # Generate all possible combinations of truth values
    table = []  # Initialize an empty list to hold the truth table rows
    for model in all_combinations:
        temp = dict()  # Create a temporary dictionary to hold truth values for symbols in a specific row
        for symbol, value in zip(symbols, model):
            temp[symbol] = value  # Assign the truth value to the symbol in the dictionary
        table.append(temp)  # Add the dictionary to the truth table as a row
        del temp  # Delete the temporary dictionary to free up memory
    return table  # Return the completed truth table
```

Let's go through each part of the function:

1. `def create_table(symbols)`: This is the function definition that takes a list of logical symbols as an argument.

2. `values = [True, False]`: This creates a list containing the possible truth values that each symbol can have: `True` or `False`.

3. `num_columns = len(symbols)`: This calculates the number of symbols in the input list, which determines the number of columns in the truth table.

4. `all_combinations = list(itertools.product(values, repeat=num_columns))`: This line generates all possible combinations of truth values for the given number of symbols using the `itertools.product()` function.

5. `table = []`: This initializes an empty list called `table` to store the rows of the truth table.

6. The `for` loop iterates through each combination of truth values (`model`) generated by `itertools.product()`.

7. Inside the loop, a temporary dictionary `temp` is created to associate each symbol with its truth value in a specific row.

8. The nested `for` loop (`for symbol, value in zip(symbols, model)`) iterates through each symbol and its corresponding truth value in the current combination.

9. `temp[symbol] = value`: This line assigns the truth value (`value`) to the symbol (`symbol`) in the temporary dictionary.

10. `table.append(temp)`: Once the temporary dictionary is populated with truth values for all symbols in the current combination, it's added as a row to the truth table.

11. `del temp`: After adding the row, the temporary dictionary is deleted to free up memory.

12. Finally, the completed truth table (list of dictionaries) is returned as the output of the function.

In essence, the `create_table` function generates a truth table by considering all possible combinations of truth values for a given set of logical symbols. Each row of the truth table is represented as a dictionary where symbols are associated with their corresponding truth values. The function is useful for analyzing logical expressions and evaluating their truth values for various scenarios.
***
## Model Check

```python
# Function to check if a given knowledge base entails a query
def model_check(knowledge, query):
    symbols = set.union(knowledge.symbols(), query.symbols())  # Gather all symbols used in both knowledge and query
    model_table = create_table(symbols)  # Create a truth table for the symbols
    final_answers = []  # Initialize an empty list to hold the query's truth values in each model
    for model in model_table:
        if knowledge.evaluate(model):  # Check if the knowledge base evaluates to True in the current model
            answer = query.evaluate(model)  # Evaluate the query in the current model
            final_answers.append(answer)  # Add the query's truth value to the list
    final_answer = all(final_answers)  # Determine if the query is True in all valid models
    return final_answer  # Return whether the knowledge base entails the query
```

Let's go through each part of the function:

1. `def model_check(knowledge, query)`: This is the function definition that takes two arguments: a `knowledge` expression (the logical knowledge base) and a `query` expression (the logical query to be checked for entailment).

2. `symbols = set.union(knowledge.symbols(), query.symbols())`: This line gathers all the symbols used in both the `knowledge` and `query` expressions by performing a union of their symbol sets.

3. `model_table = create_table(symbols)`: This line creates a truth table for the collected symbols using the `create_table` function defined earlier.

4. `final_answers = []`: This initializes an empty list called `final_answers` to hold the truth values of the `query` expression for each model.

5. The `for` loop iterates through each `model` (dictionary of symbol truth values) in the `model_table`.

6. Inside the loop, `knowledge.evaluate(model)` checks if the `knowledge` base is True in the current `model`.

7. If the `knowledge` base is True, `query.evaluate(model)` evaluates the `query` expression in the same `model`.

8. The truth value of the `query` in the current `model` is appended to the `final_answers` list.

9. After evaluating all models, `final_answer = all(final_answers)` checks if the `query` expression is True in all valid models.

10. The function returns `final_answer`, which indicates whether the given `knowledge` base entails the `query`.

In summary, the `model_check` function uses truth tables to check whether a given `knowledge` base logically entails a specific `query`. It evaluates both the `knowledge` base and the `query` for each possible model (combination of symbol truth values) and checks if the `query` is consistently true in all valid models where the `knowledge` base is also true.

print(knowledge1.formula())  # Print the formula representation of the knowledge base
print(knowledge1.symbols())  # Print the set of symbols used in the knowledge base

# Check if the knowledge base entails the statement "Harry will go for a run"
print(model_check(knowledge1, R))

# Print the negation of the statement "It is a Tuesday"
print(Not(P))

# Create a biconditional expression between P and Q
print(Biconditional(P, Q))

# Create a conjunction (AND) expression between P and Q
print(And(P, Q))
```

Here's a breakdown of the major steps in the code:


1. **Importing the Logic Module:**

   ```python
   from logic import *
   ```

   You're importing a module named `logic`, which presumably contains definitions for logical symbols and functions for working with symbolic logic.

2. **Defining Logical Symbols:**

   ```python
   rain = Symbol("rain")         # It's raining
   hagrid = Symbol("hagrid")     # Harry visited Hagrid
   dumbledore = Symbol("dumbledore")  # Harry visited Dumbledore
   ```

   Here, you're defining three logical symbols using the `Symbol` class provided by the `logic` module. These symbols represent different statements or propositions:
   
   - `rain` represents the statement "It's raining."
   - `hagrid` represents the statement "Harry visited Hagrid."
   - `dumbledore` represents the statement "Harry visited Dumbledore."

3. **Constructing Knowledge Base (KB):**

   ```python
   knowledge = And(
       Implication(Not(rain), hagrid),
       Or(hagrid, dumbledore),
       Not(And(hagrid, dumbledore)),
       dumbledore
   )
   ```

   You're building a knowledge base `knowledge` by combining multiple logical statements using the following logical operations:

   - `Implication(Not(rain), hagrid)`: This represents the logical implication "If it's not raining, then Harry visited Hagrid."
   - `Or(hagrid, dumbledore)`: This represents the logical disjunction "Harry visited Hagrid or Harry visited Dumbledore."
   - `Not(And(hagrid, dumbledore))`: This represents the negation of "Harry visited both Hagrid and Dumbledore simultaneously."
   - `dumbledore`: This is a straightforward statement that "Harry visited Dumbledore."

   All these statements are combined using the `And` operation, implying that all of them are true at the same time.

4. **Printing the Knowledge Base:**

   ```python
   print(knowledge)
   ```

   This line prints out the `knowledge` base, showing the logical statements you've defined in a readable format.

5. **Model Checking:**

   ```python
   print(model_check(knowledge, rain))
   ```

   You're using a function called `model_check` to check whether the statement `rain` is true in the context of the `knowledge` base. In other words, you're asking if it's raining based on the logical statements and rules defined in your knowledge base.

   The `model_check` function will return `True` or `False` depending on whether it can find a model (a set of truth values for the symbols) that satisfies all the conditions in the `knowledge` base. In this case, it checks if there's a model where `rain` is true given the other statements.

Overall, this code is a basic example of using symbolic logic to represent and reason about statements in a formal way, and it checks whether it's raining based on the logical relationships defined in the knowledge base.

# ==clue.py==
This code uses the `logic` module to represent and reason about the game of Clue (also known as Cluedo), a popular board game. The code defines a knowledge base and checks the possible values of different cards using the `model_check` function. Let's break down the code step by step:

```python
from logic import *

# Define logical symbols for characters, rooms, and weapons
mustard = Symbol("ColMustard")
plum = Symbol("ProfPlum")
scarlet = Symbol("MsScarlet")
characters = [mustard, plum, scarlet]

ballroom = Symbol("ballroom")
kitchen = Symbol("kitchen")
library = Symbol("library")
rooms = [ballroom, kitchen, library]

knife = Symbol("knife")
revolver = Symbol("revolver")
wrench = Symbol("wrench")
weapons = [knife, revolver, wrench]

# Combine all symbols into a single list
symbols = characters + rooms + weapons

# Function to check knowledge and print results
def check_knowledge(knowledge):
    for symbol in symbols:
        if model_check(knowledge, symbol):
            print(f"{symbol}: YES")
        elif model_check(knowledge, Not(symbol)):
            print(f"{symbol}: NO")
        else:
            print(f"{symbol}: MAYBE")

# Create an initial knowledge base
knowledge = And(
    Or(mustard, plum, scarlet),   # There must be a person
    Or(ballroom, kitchen, library),  # There must be a room
    Or(knife, revolver, wrench)  # There must be a weapon
)

# Add more information to the knowledge base
knowledge.add(And(
    Not(mustard), Not(kitchen), Not(revolver)
))

knowledge.add(Or(
    Not(scarlet), Not(library), Not(wrench)
))

# Check and print the possible values of each card
check_knowledge(knowledge)
```

Here's what the code does:

1. Logical symbols are defined for characters, rooms, and weapons using the `Symbol` class.

2. Lists of characters, rooms, and weapons are created.

3. All logical symbols are combined into a single list called `symbols`.

4. The `check_knowledge` function is defined. It takes a `knowledge` expression as input and checks whether each symbol in `symbols` is true, false, or undetermined based on the `knowledge`.

5. An initial knowledge base is created using logical expressions. It states that there must be a person, room, and weapon.

6. Additional constraints are added to the knowledge base using logical expressions. These constraints represent certain cards being known or not known based on the provided information.

7. The `check_knowledge` function is called with the `knowledge` base, and it prints whether each card is possibly true (YES), possibly false (NO), or unknown (MAYBE) based on the knowledge.

The code essentially simulates reasoning about the game of Clue by using symbolic logic to determine the possible values of different cards given the provided information.

# ==mastermind.py==
This code represents a logic puzzle in which you have to deduce the positions and colors of objects based on certain rules. The puzzle involves four colors ("red," "blue," "green," "yellow") and four positions (numbered 0 to 3). The goal is to determine the color of each object in each position based on the given constraints. Let's break down the code step by step:

```python
from logic import *

# Define colors and create symbols for each color-position combination
colors = ["red", "blue", "green", "yellow"]
symbols = []
for i in range(4):
    for color in colors:
        symbols.append(Symbol(f"{color}{i}"))

# Initialize an empty knowledge base
knowledge = And()

# Add constraints to the knowledge base

# Each color has a position.
for color in colors:
    knowledge.add(Or(
        Symbol(f"{color}0"),
        Symbol(f"{color}1"),
        Symbol(f"{color}2"),
        Symbol(f"{color}3")
    ))

# Only one position per color.
for color in colors:
    for i in range(4):
        for j in range(4):
            if i != j:
                knowledge.add(Implication(
                    Symbol(f"{color}{i}"), Not(Symbol(f"{color}{j}"))
                ))

# Only one color per position.
for i in range(4):
    for c1 in colors:
        for c2 in colors:
            if c1 != c2:
                knowledge.add(Implication(
                    Symbol(f"{c1}{i}"), Not(Symbol(f"{c2}{i}"))
                ))

# Add specific conditions based on the given information
knowledge.add(Or(
    # Specific conditions for object colors and positions
))

knowledge.add(And(
    Not(Symbol("blue0")), Not(Symbol("red1")), Not(Symbol("green2")), Not(Symbol("yellow3"))
))

# Print the knowledge base, symbols, and deduced solutions
print(knowledge)
print(symbols)
for symbol in symbols:
    if model_check(knowledge, symbol):
        print(symbol)
```

Here's a breakdown of the code:

1. The code begins by importing the `logic` module.

2. A list `colors` is defined to represent the available colors. Symbols are created for each color-position combination (e.g., "red0," "blue1," etc.) using nested loops.

3. An empty knowledge base `knowledge` is initialized using the `And()` class.

4. Constraints are added to the knowledge base using nested loops and logical expressions:
   - Each color must have a position.
   - Only one position per color.
   - Only one color per position.

5. Specific conditions based on the given information are added to the knowledge base using the `knowledge.add()` method. These conditions represent specific scenarios involving colors and positions.

6. The final condition restricts certain color-position combinations that are known not to be true.

7. The knowledge base, symbols, and deduced solutions are printed:
   - The knowledge base is printed using `print(knowledge)`.
   - The list of symbols is printed using `print(symbols)`.
   - The code uses the `model_check` function to check each symbol and print the ones that are deduced to be true based on the given constraints.

The code essentially sets up a logical puzzle involving colors and positions, defines the constraints, adds specific conditions, and then uses logical reasoning to deduce which color-position combinations are possible solutions to the puzzle.
