import itertools
```

In Python, `itertools` is a standard library module that provides a collection of fast, memory-efficient tools for working with iterators, which are objects that can be iterated (looped) over, like lists, tuples, and more. The `itertools` module contains various functions that allow you to create and manipulate iterators, often in combination with one another, to perform various tasks efficiently.

When you see the line `import itertools` in a Python script or program, it means that the code is importing the `itertools` module so that its functionality can be utilized within the script.

class Symbol():

    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

    def __repr__(self):
        return self.name

    def evaluate(self, model):
        try:
            return (model[self.name])
        except KeyError:
            raise Exception(f"variable {self.name} not in model")

    def formula(self):
        return self.name

    def symbols(self):
        return {self.name}
```

let's break down the details of the `Symbol` class step by step:

```python
class Symbol():

    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
```

Here, you're defining a class named `Symbol`. This class has a constructor method `__init__()` that takes a parameter `name`. Inside the constructor, the value of the parameter is assigned to an instance variable `self.name`.

```python
    def __repr__(self):
        return self.name
```

The `__repr__()` method is defined to customize the string representation of an instance of the `Symbol` class. It returns the value of `self.name`, which will be used when you call the `repr()` function on an instance of this class.

```python
    def evaluate(self, model):
        try:
            return model[self.name]
        except KeyError:
            raise Exception(f"variable {self.name} not in model")
```

The `evaluate()` method takes a parameter `model`, which is presumably a dictionary-like object containing variable names as keys and their corresponding values. Inside the method, it attempts to retrieve the value associated with `self.name` from the `model`. If the key `self.name` doesn't exist in the `model`, a `KeyError` will be raised. In that case, an `Exception` is raised with a message indicating that the variable is not found in the model.

```python
    def formula(self):
        return self.name
```

The `formula()` method returns the value of `self.name`. This method is used to obtain the name of the symbol, which might be useful when you want to represent the symbol in a formulaic context.

```python
    def symbols(self):
        return {self.name}
```

The `symbols()` method returns a set containing the name of the symbol (`self.name`). This method is used to extract the set of symbols present in a particular context. The set is enclosed in curly braces `{}`.

To summarize, the `Symbol` class represents a symbol with a given name. It has methods to retrieve the symbol's name, evaluate its value within a provided model, retrieve the symbol's formulaic representation, and extract the set of symbols contained within the instance. This class seems to be a part of a larger system that deals with symbolic expressions and mathematical modeling, where symbols (variables) are associated with values for computation and analysis.

class Not():
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

    def __repr__(self):
        return f"Not({self.name})"

    def evaluate(self, model):
        return not self.name.evaluate(model)

    def formula(self):
        return "¬" + self.name.formula()

    def symbols(self):
        return self.name.symbols()
```
Let's delve into the details of the `Not` class:

```python
class Not():
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
```

Here, you're defining a class named `Not`. This class seems to represent the logical negation operation, which takes a symbol or another logical expression as an operand. The constructor method `__init__()` takes a parameter `name`, which represents the operand being negated. The `name` is stored as an instance variable `self.name`.

```python
    def __repr__(self):
        return f"Not({self.name})"
```

The `__repr__()` method is defined to provide a custom string representation of an instance of the `Not` class. It returns a string in the format `"Not(<operand>)"`, where `<operand>` is the string representation of the `name` operand.

```python
    def evaluate(self, model):
        return not self.name.evaluate(model)
```

The `evaluate()` method calculates the logical negation of the operand's evaluation result using the provided `model`. It calls the `evaluate()` method of the `name` operand with the given `model` and then negates the result using the `not` operator. This simulates the behavior of logical negation.

```python
    def formula(self):
        return "¬" + self.name.formula()
```

The `formula()` method returns a string representation of the formula formed by applying logical negation to the operand's formula. It adds the "¬" (negation) symbol to the beginning of the operand's formula, creating a new formula that represents the negation of the original formula.

```python
    def symbols(self):
        return self.name.symbols()
```

The `symbols()` method returns the set of symbols present in the operand's expression. It does this by calling the `symbols()` method of the `name` operand. This method allows you to retrieve all the symbols used in the negation expression.

In summary, the `Not` class represents the logical negation of a symbol or logical expression. It has methods to retrieve the custom string representation of the negation, evaluate the negation using a model, generate the formula for the negation expression, and extract the symbols present in the expression. This class seems to be part of a system for working with logical expressions and truth values.

class And():
    def __init__(self, *conjuncts):

    def __repr__(self):
        conjunctions = ", ".join(
            [str(conjunct) for conjunct in self.conjuncts]
        )
        return f"And({conjunctions})"

    def add(self, conjunct):
        self.conjuncts.append(conjunct)

    def evaluate(self, model):
        return all(conjunct.evaluate(model) for conjunct in self.conjuncts)

    def formula(self):

        return " ∧ ".join([conjunct.formula() for conjunct in self.conjuncts])

    def symbols(self):
        return set.union(*[conjunct.symbols() for conjunct in self.conjuncts])
```

let's dive into the details of the `And` class:

```python
class And():
    def __init__(self, *conjuncts):
        self.conjuncts = list(conjuncts)
```

Here, you're defining a class named `And`. This class seems to represent the logical AND operation, which takes multiple logical expressions (conjuncts) as operands. The constructor method `__init__()` takes any number of arguments (`*conjuncts`) and converts them into a list called `self.conjuncts`, which stores the individual conjuncts.

```python
    def __repr__(self):
        conjunctions = ", ".join(
            [str(conjunct) for conjunct in self.conjuncts]
        )
        return f"And({conjunctions})"
```

The `__repr__()` method provides a custom string representation of an instance of the `And` class. It generates a string that lists the individual conjuncts separated by commas, enclosed in the format `"And(<conjuncts>)"`.

```python
    def add(self, conjunct):
        self.conjuncts.append(conjunct)
```

The `add()` method allows you to add additional conjuncts to an existing instance of the `And` class. This method appends the provided `conjunct` to the list of existing conjuncts.

```python
    def evaluate(self, model):
        return all(conjunct.evaluate(model) for conjunct in self.conjuncts)
```

The `evaluate()` method calculates the logical AND of all the conjuncts' evaluation results using the provided `model`. It iterates through each conjunct, calls its `evaluate()` method with the given `model`, and then uses the built-in `all()` function to check if all the conjuncts evaluate to `True`.

```python
    def formula(self):
        if len(self.conjuncts) == 1:
            return self.conjuncts[0].formula()
        return " ∧ ".join([conjunct.formula() for conjunct in self.conjuncts])
```

The `formula()` method generates a string representation of the logical formula represented by the conjunction of the conjuncts. If there's only one conjunct, it returns its formula. Otherwise, it joins the formulas of all conjuncts using the "∧" (logical AND) symbol.

```python
    def symbols(self):
        return set.union(*[conjunct.symbols() for conjunct in self.conjuncts])
```

The `symbols()` method returns the set of symbols present in all the conjuncts. It does this by calling the `symbols()` method of each conjunct and then performing a set union operation to combine all the symbol sets.

In summary, the `And` class represents the logical conjunction of multiple logical expressions (conjuncts). It allows adding new conjuncts, evaluating the conjunction using a model, generating the formula for the conjunction expression, and extracting the symbols present in the expression. This class is designed for working with logical expressions involving conjunctions.

```

The `evaluate()` method calculates the logical OR of all the disjuncts' evaluation results using the provided `model`. It iterates through each disjunct, calls its `evaluate()` method with the given `model`, and then uses the built-in `any()` function to check if at least one of the disjuncts evaluates to `True`.

```python

Here, you're defining a class named `Implication`. This class seems to represent the logical implication operation (→), which takes two logical expressions as operands: the left-hand side (left) and the right-hand side (right). The constructor method `__init__()` takes two parameters, `left` and `right`, representing the two sides of the implication. These are stored as instance variables, `self.left` and `self.right`.

```python

The `evaluate()` method calculates the result of the implication using the provided `model`. It evaluates the logical NOT of the left-hand side using the `not` operator and then evaluates the logical OR of the negated left-hand side and the right-hand side. This simulates the behavior of the implication operation.

```python
    def formula(self):
        left = self.left.formula()
        right = self.right.formula()

```

The `evaluate()` method calculates the result of the biconditional using the provided `model`. It evaluates the logical AND of both sides and the logical NOT of both sides, and then uses the logical OR operator to combine these results. This simulates the behavior of the biconditional operation.

```python

        left = str(self.left)
        right = str(self.right)

The `symbols()` method returns the set of symbols present in both the left-hand side and the right-hand side of the biconditional. It does this by performing a set union operation on the symbol sets of `self.left` and `self.right`.

In summary, the `Biconditional` class represents the logical biconditional operation (↔) between two logical expressions.

            temp[symbol] = value
        table.append(temp)
        del (temp)
    return table
```

The `create_table` function generates a truth table for a given set of symbols. It computes all possible combinations of truth values for the symbols and creates a table that associates these combinations with their corresponding values in a dictionary format.

Let's break down the function step by step:

1. The `symbols` parameter is a list of symbolic names (variables).

2. `values` is a list containing `True` and `False`, representing the possible truth values.

3. `num_columns` calculates the number of symbols, which corresponds to the number of columns in the truth table.

4. `all_combinations` is created using `itertools.product` to generate all possible combinations of truth values for the symbols. It's a list of tuples where each tuple represents a single row in the truth table.

5. The loop iterates through each combination (`model`) in `all_combinations`.

6. Inside the loop, a temporary dictionary `temp` is created to represent a row in the truth table. The loop then pairs each symbol with its corresponding truth value using the `zip()` function, and adds these pairs to the `temp` dictionary.

7. After adding all symbol-value pairs to `temp`, the `temp` dictionary is appended to the `table` list, which represents the truth table.

8. The `temp` dictionary is deleted using `del` to free up memory for the next iteration.

9. Finally, the function returns the generated `table` containing dictionaries representing each row of the truth table.

In summary, the `create_table` function generates a truth table for a set of symbols by computing all possible combinations of truth values for those symbols. It returns a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents a row in the truth table with symbols as keys and their corresponding truth values as values.

            final_answers.append(answer)
    final_answer = all(final_answers)
    return final_answer
```

The `model_check` function implements a basic model checking procedure. It checks whether a given logical `knowledge` and `query` are true in all possible models, which are generated using a truth table approach. Let's break down the function step by step:

1. The `knowledge` parameter is a logical expression representing the background knowledge, and the `query` parameter is the logical expression you want to evaluate.

2. The function starts by creating a set of symbols by taking the union of the symbols present in both the `knowledge` and `query` expressions.

3. The `model_table` is generated using the `create_table` function, which provides all possible truth value combinations for the symbols.

4. The loop iterates through each model in the `model_table`.

5. Inside the loop, it checks if the `knowledge` is true in the current `model` by calling the `evaluate` method of the `knowledge` expression with the current `model`.

6. If the `knowledge` is true in the current `model`, the `query` expression is evaluated in the same `model`, and the result is stored in the `final_answers` list.

7. After iterating through all models, the `final_answers` list contains a list of truth values for the `query` expression across all models where the `knowledge` is true.

8. The `final_answer` is calculated using the `all()` function to check if all values in `final_answers` are `True`, indicating that the `query` is true in all models where the `knowledge` is true.

9. The function returns the `final_answer`, which represents whether the `query` is logically entailed by the `knowledge` in all possible models where the `knowledge` holds.

In summary, the `model_check` function performs model checking by generating a truth table of all possible models, evaluating the `knowledge` and `query` expressions for each model, and checking if the `query` holds in all models where the `knowledge` holds. It returns a boolean value indicating whether the `query` is logically entailed by the `knowledge` using this model checking approach.

hagrid = Symbol("hagrid") #Harry visited Hagrid
dumbledore = Symbol("dumbledore") #Harry visited dumbledore
```

The code snippet defines three symbolic variables: `rain`, `hagrid`, and `dumbledore`. Each of these variables seems to represent a different event or condition in a logical context.

Here's a breakdown of what the code does:

1. The `from logic import *` statement imports all symbols and functions defined in the `logic` module. This module has been explained above.

2. `Symbol("rain")`, `Symbol("hagrid")`, and `Symbol("dumbledore")` create instances of the `Symbol` class from the `logic` module, representing different conditions or events in a logical context.

These symbols can be used to represent various conditions, and you can manipulate and combine them using the logical operators and functions provided by the `logic` module. The code sets the stage for building logical expressions and performing operations on them to model different scenarios or situations.
***
The `knowledge` variable is being assigned a logical expression that represents a collection of knowledge or constraints. The expression appears to define a set of conditions and relationships using logical operators. Let's break down the `knowledge` expression step by step:

```python
knowledge = And(
    Implication(Not(rain), hagrid),
    Or(hagrid, dumbledore),
    Not(And(hagrid, dumbledore)),
    dumbledore
)
```

1. `Implication(Not(rain), hagrid)` represents the logical implication "If it's not raining, then Harry visited Hagrid." This implies that if it's not raining, Harry did visit Hagrid.

2. `Or(hagrid, dumbledore)` represents the logical disjunction "Harry visited Hagrid or Harry visited Dumbledore." This states that either Harry visited Hagrid or he visited Dumbledore or both.

3. `Not(And(hagrid, dumbledore))` represents the logical negation of "Harry visited both Hagrid and Dumbledore simultaneously." This indicates that Harry did not visit both of them together.

4. `dumbledore` simply represents the fact that Harry visited Dumbledore.

5. Finally, the entire `knowledge` expression is encapsulated in the `And()` function, which means that all of these conditions must be true simultaneously for the knowledge to hold.

In summary, the `knowledge` expression represents a logical set of constraints and relationships involving Harry's visits to Hagrid and Dumbledore, as well as the weather condition of raining. This logical expression can be used to reason about various scenarios and evaluate the truth or falsity of different combinations of events.
***
The `model_check` function is being used here to check whether the variable `rain` is logically entailed by the given `knowledge` expression. In other words, it checks whether, based on the defined knowledge, it must necessarily be true that it's raining. Let's see what the output of this code might be:

```python
print(model_check(knowledge, rain))
```

Assuming that the `model_check` function and the `knowledge` expression are implemented correctly based on the previous discussions, the output of this code will indicate whether the knowledge implies that it is raining or not.

If the output is `True`, it means that based on the provided knowledge, it must be true that it is raining. If the output is `False`, it means that the knowledge does not necessarily imply that it is raining. The output will reflect the logical consequence of the `knowledge` expression with respect to the `rain` variable.
***
```
P = Symbol("It is a Tuesday")
Q = Symbol("It is Raining")
R = Symbol("Harry will go for a run")
```
You have defined three symbolic variables using the `Symbol` class:

1. `P` represents the statement "It is a Tuesday."
2. `Q` represents the statement "It is Raining."
3. `R` represents the statement "Harry will go for a run."

These symbolic variables will likely be used to build logical expressions and reason about various scenarios using the logical operators and constructs provided by the logic module you are working with.
***
The `knowledge1` expression is constructed using the `And()` function to represent a logical conjunction of multiple conditions. It appears to define a logical scenario involving the statements represented by the symbols `P`, `Q`, and `R`. Let's break down the `knowledge1` expression:

```python
knowledge1 = And(
    Implication(And(P, Not(Q)), R),
    P,
    Not(Q)
)
```

1. `Implication(And(P, Not(Q)), R)` represents the logical implication "If it is a Tuesday and it is not raining, then Harry will go for a run." This implies that if both "It is a Tuesday" (`P`) and "It is not Raining" (`Not(Q)`) are true, then "Harry will go for a run" (`R`) is true.

2. `P` represents the statement "It is a Tuesday."

3. `Not(Q)` represents the statement "It is not Raining."

4. The entire `knowledge1` expression is encapsulated in the `And()` function, which means that all of these conditions must be true simultaneously for the knowledge to hold.

When you print the `knowledge1` expression using `print(knowledge1)`, it will display the string representation of the logical expression you've created. The output will show how the various conditions are combined using logical operators. Keep in mind that the actual output format might depend on the specific logic library or module you are using in your code.
***
```
knowledge1.formula()
knowledge1.symbols()

model_check(knowledge1, R)

print(Not(P))

Biconditional(P,Q)
And(P,Q)
```

Let's go through each of the provided expressions and statements:

1. `knowledge1.formula()`:
   This will return a string representation of the formula represented by the `knowledge1` expression. The output should be similar to the logical expression you provided when constructing `knowledge1`. For example, if your logic library formats formulas like standard logical notation, the output might look like:
   ```
   ((P ∧ ¬Q) => R) ∧ P ∧ ¬Q
   ```

2. `knowledge1.symbols()`:
   This will return the set of symbols present in the `knowledge1` expression. Since you have used `P`, `Q`, and `R` in `knowledge1`, the output should be a set containing these symbols: `{P, Q, R}`.

3. `model_check(knowledge1, R)`:
   This will use the `model_check` function to check if the statement "Harry will go for a run" (`R`) is logically entailed by `knowledge1`. The output will be a boolean value indicating whether, based on the given knowledge, it must be true that Harry will go for a run.

4. `print(Not(P))`:
   This will print the logical negation of the statement "It is a Tuesday" (`P`). If the logic library formats negations as "¬P", the output will be `¬P`.

5. `Biconditional(P, Q)`:
   This seems to create a biconditional expression between `P` and `Q`. A biconditional states that `P` is true if and only if `Q` is true, and vice versa. The output of this line would be the biconditional expression representation.

6. `And(P, Q)`:
   This creates a logical AND expression between `P` and `Q`, stating that both `P` and `Q` must be true. The output of this line would be the AND expression representation.
